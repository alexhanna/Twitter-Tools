# Twitter Tools v0.01

This is a set of tools for collecting tweets from Twitter, via the
Streaming and RESTful APIs.  This set of tools is in no way fully
exploits the potential of what can be done with the Twitter API.  I
admit that they were first written the summer of 2010 to collect data
around the 2010 US midterm elections.  

My vision for this toolset is to extend it in such a way that
researchers like myself can collect and use Twitter datasets easily
and without much technical knowledge.  I work in the social sciences
and passing someone a Perl script when they think that /bin/bash is a
social event isn't the most useful thing to do.
